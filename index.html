	<p class="maintext">
<b>Updates:</b><br>
<b>-October 30th 2019:</b> Big update! The tab system has been reformatted, you will find that there are now two new pages on the site. 'Papa's Games' and 'Papa's Games Desktop'. These are a list of the Papa-eria games formatted for chromebooks and desktops respectively. You may also notice that the order of tabs from left to right is slightly different.<br>
<b>-October 25th, 2019:</b> Agar.io was blocked! We deleted it from the games list and moved JackSmith to its place. Please contact us if you know of an unblocked agar.io link!<br>
<b>-October 24th, 2019:</b> All of the messages from October 24th or earlier were deleted from the group chat. This should significantly reduce the lag that some users were experiencing. If the last message you sent in the groupchat was before the 24th, you may not recieve notifications until you send another.<br>
<b>-October 23rd, 2019:</b> We've removed or replaced all of the blocked links. Every game, as of typing this, is unblocked *including Super Smash*<br> 
<b>-October 18th, 2019:</b> We've fixed the issue of the buttons opening new tabs.<br>	
<b>-October 15th, 2019:</b> We now have tabs at the top and bottom of this page that link to various sites. This keeps Big Smacky organized and keeps the site from looking ugly.<br>	
<b>-October 7th, 2019:</b> We've got a new address, but that doesn't matter, cause you're always home at Big Smacky's. So pick up where you left off: playing games and having fun. Let your freinds know we're back, and remember: the school may have tried to shut us down, but NO ONE can hold Big Smacky down!</p>
